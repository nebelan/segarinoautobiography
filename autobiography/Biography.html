            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
             I am a dedicated Computer Technology student with a solid foundation in web design. My background has equipped me with a keen eye for user-centric design and front-end development principles.
              I am driven by a strong passion for growth and am highly adaptable, always eager to embrace new challenges and technologies to deliver effective solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
               I have a practical background in web design, where I developed skills in creating structured and visually engaging layouts. This is paired with experience in C++ programming, which has given me a deep understanding of logical structuring, data handling,
                and computational thinking. This blend of high-level design and low-level logic makes me a versatile and analytical problem-solver.

            <h2>Personal Life</h2>
            <p>
                My life, at nineteen, is deeply enriched by my wonderful family in Lapu-Lapu City. I have three siblings, and together with our incredible mother and father,
                 we form a close-knit and joyful unit. What makes our family truly special is the unconditional support that flows freely between us. We are each other's biggest 
                 cheerleaders during times of success and a sturdy shoulder to lean on during times of struggle. This lifelong 
                commitment to lifting each other up is the source of our great happiness and the foundation of a home filled with love, respect, and endless encouragement.
            </p>
            <p>
               I'm a person who finds joy in both creation and exploration. My hands are usually busy painting, drawing, or 
               playing games, while my soul is refreshed by regular walks in the fresh air. My adventures have taken me to the beautiful local
                islands of Bohol and Masbate, and these experiences have filled me with a great appreciation for the natural wonders we have right here in the Philippines.
